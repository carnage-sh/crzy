Update your test environments in seconds

## the challenge

Running test environments can take several minutes. 

- Configuring a new set of toolchains and representative data set in order to
  run your integration tests can take some time
- Building an artifact locally like a container image or an executable to make
  it available from a remote location can also take some time
- Deploying DNS records 

## configuration

```shell
git remote add server http://localhost:8080/color/.git
git push server
```
