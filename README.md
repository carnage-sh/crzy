# crzy

Update your test environments in 3 seconds

## the challenge

Running test environments can take several minutes. It might require:

- deploying infrastructure components
- installing compilers, tools, databases
- managing secrets and configurations
- running tests
- building, sharing and deploying artifacts

## overview

crzy relies on core principles to provide fast updates: 

- `anticipate` by preparing as much as possible
- `speed up` by optimizing steps alone and together
- `postpone` non-vital operations
- `simplify` user interactions

## configuration

```shell
git remote add server http://${SERVER}:8080/color/.git
git push server
```
